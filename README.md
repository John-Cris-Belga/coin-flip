# Coin Flip App

This is a simple Coin Flip application built using React and Vite. The app allows users to choose which side of the coin they think will face up and then flips the coin to see if they guessed correctly.

## Features

- **Choose Side**: The user can select which side of the coin (heads or tails) they think will face up.
- **Button Enable/Disable**: The "Rotate Coin" button is disabled until the user picks a side. Once a side is chosen, the button becomes enabled.
- **Coin Rotation**: When the "Rotate Coin" button is clicked, the coin will rotate randomly for 6 seconds.
- **Result and Confetti**: After 6 seconds, the coin will stop. If the user's chosen side is faceup, a confetti animation will be displayed to celebrate the correct guess.
